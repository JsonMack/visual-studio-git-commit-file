# Git Reference To Txt File
### A visual studio code extension that creates a .txt file with the last commit reference on the desktop or some user-defined path.

# User-defined settings
You can update your .code-workspace file to modify the path that the .txt file is created in and remove credits (I mean, why would you though?).

```json
    "settings": {
        "gitReferenceToTxt.folderAbsolutePath": "C:/My/Custom/Path",
        "gitReferenceToTxt.credits": false
    }
```

Created by Jason MacKeigan for the 2020 PROG1700 class. I mean, the other guys can use it too I guess.
